#OECD Government Debt to GBP Ratio, Visualized 2

For this visualization, I experimented with a bunch of different versions of this, including lines charts and geographic heat map style visualizations. Eventually, I chose to go with the a bubble chart, since this way, just the size of the bubble would give the viewer the same info as a line graph but much quicker. 

I also decided to keep the trendlines for each country/year in the background even though it made it a bit busier, because this way you could see the minimum and maximum for each country, which tells a story in and of itself. 

I added two columns to the dataset as well, the original country name and the continent, so that I could color based on the continent. Ina future iteration, I would have liked to see the x axis grouped by continent, but I couldn't quite figure out how to change that on FLourish.
