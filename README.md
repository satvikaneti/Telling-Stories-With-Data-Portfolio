# Telling Stories with Data Portfolio

https://satvikaneti.github.io/Telling-Stories-With-Data-Portfolio/

This is a portfolio for Satvika Neti's work in the class Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University. 

### Storytelling through data, for communities

Satvika (she/her/hers) is passionate about the power of narrative, the importance of data and technology, and the necessity for intersectional justice for all communities. Her definition of intersectionality stems from embracing the hyphens of her identity, bridging the gap between her experiences, and expanding the work an organization is doing to include more people. 

Satvika is currently a student in Heinz's MSPPM-DA program, and has previously: organized Femisphere Codeswitch, a hackathon to design digital solutions for single moms in poverty, been a founding member of Rangoli Pittsburgh, an initiative created to amplify the voices of the South Asian LGBTQIA+ community in Pittsburgh, and served on Mayor Peduto’s LGBTQIA+ Advisory Council. Prior to coming to Heinz, she was honored as a Sprout Fund Legacy Awardee, by Governor Tom Wolf’s Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs as an Asian American Heritage Month honoree, and as a TEDx University of Pittsburgh speaker. Satvika Neti is a 2016 graduate of Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor of Science in International Relations and Politics and a double minor in Computer Science and Policy and Management.

### What I hope to learn

My goal is to become a data journalist, to continue to tell stories with data in a way that helps marginalized people truly thrive. To do that, I want to learn what tools I might be able to use while working for an organization without the funds for Tableau, how to spot leading data or graphs from more objectives ones, and how to create a graph that would speak to the most people to tell specific stories. I'm interested in learning how to use narratives and words to go along with graphs and charts as well as design principles. I'm also intersted in finding out how to make interactive graphics and visualizations that people can play with to learn more about a certain issue area, or to take action on something that they care about (send an email to their rep, etc). 

I'm also particularly interested in thinking about which stories to tell, and learning how to get the data that would best help me tell that story.
