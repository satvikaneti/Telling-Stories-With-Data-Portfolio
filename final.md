# What can Shakespeare tell us about digital organizing? 

### Part 1 & 2

During parts one and two of my final project, I first wanted to focus on "what makes a good story" from a data scientist point of view, and then look at how that might help us find ways to do digital organizing better. 

Through a lot of back and forth and conversations with friends, and feedback from users, I narrowed it down to the question "What can Shakespeare's narrative structure tell us about digital organizing?" During the user research phase, I sent out some initial visualizations and storyboards to some friends to see what they thought. 

A lot of the feedback I got was that there was too much data to focus on (so cut down on the number of plays/characters I focus on) and also that the connection between this and digital organizing was still pretty opaque. Their feedback helped me realize that the audience for this story is digitial organizers, and that helped me frame the larger story around my visualizations, rather than the other way around. 

### Part 3

For the last part of this final project, I ended up making a bunch of visualizations on Tableau (instead of R, like I had previously). But this time instead of just throwing the data into it and seeing what happened, I in particular wanted to answer some of my own questions about digital organizing structure: What does a good beginning look like? How often do you ask for things like money or volunteering? I also struggled a little bit with the fact that in the real world, digital organizing is fast paced and messy. Organizers don't always have the time to be spending crafting large scale arcs like this, or even if they do, any tiny event could derail the whole campaign in a rapid response crisis. But, even so, I think there's enough here for organizers to still be able to gain something for their craft, and in the end it's another tool in their toolbox they can use if they want to.
