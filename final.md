# What makes a good story? 

For my final project, I'd like to explore the age old question - what makes a story good? 

Stories have been around since we've been around, passed down from generation to generation, told around the campfire, theaters, movie screens, books - storytelling is what makes us human, what makes us connect with one another in our shared humanity. 

Stories are how we interact with each other, how we inherit legacies. And they are important for that reason alone. 

But they're also a powerful tool for organizing, for persuading. Organizers have known this forever, but the story we tell of a better world is how we attract people to the cause - get them to volunteer, knock doors, and donate. And digital organizers, especially, are tasked with connecting those on the ground with the larger mission and vision - a better world is possible, and we can build it. 

My love for stories is part of why I wanted to take this class, but I also wanted to explore something more - what makes a good story? It's not a new question - people ahve been asking it since stories themselves were created. Is it characters? Structure? Plot? Language? The right answer is, of course, some combination of all of those. Since I started exploring this concept, I started consuming so much content on what exactly makes a good story. One of the books I picked up (through my screenwriting class last semester) was Syd Field's seminal work <i>Screenplay</i>. In it, Fields talks about the three act structure - the narrative arc of story, and how all good stories fit into that. 

So I was curious - does that hold up? And is there more that we can pull out, using data, that tells us what good stories look like?
