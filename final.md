# What can Shakespeare tell us about digital organizing? 

### Part 1 & 2

During [parts one and two of my final project](https://satvikaneti.github.io/Telling-Stories-With-Data-Portfolio/final_part1and2.html), I first wanted to focus on "what makes a good story" from a data scientist point of view, and then look at how that might help us find ways to do digital organizing better. 

Through a lot of back and forth and conversations with friends, and feedback from users, I narrowed it down to the question "What can Shakespeare's narrative structure tell us about digital organizing?" During the user research phase, I sent out some initial visualizations and storyboards to some friends to see what they thought. 

A lot of the feedback I got was that there was too much data to focus on (so cut down on the number of plays/characters I focus on) and also that the connection between this and digital organizing was still pretty opaque. Their feedback helped me realize that the audience for this story is digitial organizers, and that helped me frame the larger story around my visualizations, rather than the other way around. 

### Part 3

For the last part of this final project, I ended up making a bunch of visualizations on Tableau (instead of R, like I had previously). But this time instead of just throwing the data into it and seeing what happened, I in particular wanted to answer some of my own questions about digital organizing structure: What does a good beginning look like? How often do you ask for things like money or volunteering? How do you handle multiple asks, or multiple viewpoints in your own campaign? 

I also struggled a little bit with the fact that in the real world, digital organizing is fast paced and messy. Organizers don't always have the time to be spending crafting large scale arcs like this, or even if they do, any tiny event could derail the whole campaign in a rapid response crisis. But, even so, I think there's enough here for organizers to still be able to gain something for their craft, and in the end it's another tool in their toolbox they can use if they want to. 

I also decided to focus on only three plays - which, conviently, ended up being (of the plays I've read) the most produced, least produced, and one right in the middle. It was important to me to look at only the plays I had experience with myself, because I wanted to be able to infuse the qualitative analysis that was only possible if you've read the play yourself. This was also something that was emphasized in the feedback from Part 2. 

Once I had the questions I wanted to answer, I was able to draw out the specific visualizations I needed to answer them from those three plays. Once I created the plots on Tableau, I then took screenshots and brought them over to Canva to help distinguish some of the characters from one another. Blue for main characters or main plot, yellow for subplot or subplot characters, and brown for other secondary characters. This was the color scheme I used for all the visualizations. 

I made most of the interaction plots first, and then did the structure analysis plots. The order of importance plots came last. I initially wasn't going to include the high level plot data (which shows all the characters lines for the whole show) because it felt too messy, but I actually really liked how you could see interactions between characters and see where subplots were happening in a way that you couldn't on any of the other plots. So I ended up adding them for anyone who wanted to look further, but didn't dwell on them during the presentation. 

Overall, this was a really fun project! I got to explore something I've been curious about for a long time. There's obviously a lot more to do here, from looking at the words of the plays (something I very specifically did not do in this project, because I wanted to focus on structure), to looking at how the themes of the stories play out. I would also love to get other digital organizers to look at this, and get their thoughts on it, as well other folks who are Shakespeare buffs. This obviously isn't meant to be a "visualizing Shakespeare" project, but more of a look at visualizing what he did might help with movement work. But I think I got some interesting insights, and I'll definitely be trying out some of these things in my work if I work in digital organizing again!
