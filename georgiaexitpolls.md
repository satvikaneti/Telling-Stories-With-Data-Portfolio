# First Assignment

For this data visualization critique, I chose to do a redesign of NBC's Georgia exit polls, [which can be found here](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/georgia-president-results).

# Feedback

Can you tell me what you think this is?

1. I think that this is a visualization of the demographics of Georgia voters who voted for Biden

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

2. This visualization is telling me that Biden voters polled in Georgia were overwhelmingly white, but fairly equally split in their perspectives on current issues. Additionally, the graph shows me that despite white voters making up the majority of Biden’s vote share, Black women as a demographic overwhelmingly voted for Biden.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

3. I am surprised that only 50% of voters aged 18-29 voted for Biden, considering popular narratives about young voters being majority Democrats

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

4. I think the intended audience is individuals looking to better understand the demographics of voters in a swing state like Georgia. This visualization helps in comprehending the differences and similarities in voter demographics between Democratic and Republican voters. This could be a tool for political strategists to better assess where to focus funding and campaign efforts.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

5. I might clarify the title of the graph to reflect “percent of demographic voting for Biden...” to avoid confusion about how the graph is read
